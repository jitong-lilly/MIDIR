This repository contains the codes to address the reviewers' comments on the article "Direct Estimation for Commonly Used Pattern-Mixture Models in Clinical Trials". To use the codes, please download all codes and make sure they are in the same folder. Set the working directory in R to the downloaded folder, and run "MIDIR_analysis_simgbda_XXX.R" codes to obtain the estimation results and tipping point analysis for four imputation models using the proposed direct estimation method.
